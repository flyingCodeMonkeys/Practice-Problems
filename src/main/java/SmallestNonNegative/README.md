arr = [0,1,2,3] ---> 4

Give me the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array

arr[0...15] -> 16
arr  = [0,1,4] --> 2
array is unsorted
possibly multiple same integer in input

min = 0

Map<Int, Boolean> smallest 
{0:true}
{1:true}

[0,17] 


O(1)
N positive numbers 
>N
0 ---> N  is less than Integer.MAX_VALUE


[0,1,4] --> 2
[4,1,0] --> 2


arr = [0,1,2,3] ---> 4

[0,1,2,3,4,5,6] --> 7

arr.length

hash_map = {0:1, 1:1, 2:0, 3:0, 4:1}'


for num in arr:
    hasm_map[num[i]] is in arr

return arr.length
