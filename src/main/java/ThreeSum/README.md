Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.


EXAMPLE 1

Input1 : nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output1: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

EXAMPLE 2

Input2 : nums = []
Output2: []

EXAMPLE 3

Input3 : nums = [0]
Output3: []


Constraints:
- 0 <= nums.length <= 3000
- -105 <= nums[i] <= 105
